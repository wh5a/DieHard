 DieHard automatically hardens software applications against a wide
 range of bugs. These bugs -- known as memory errors -- often end up
 as serious security vulnerabilities, cause crashes, or lead to
 unpredictable behavior. DieHard either eliminates these bugs
 altogether, or avoids them with high probability. In other words,
 DieHard can take some buggy programs and make them bug-free (or close
 to it).
