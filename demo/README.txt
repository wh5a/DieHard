This directory contains files that demonstrate DieHard's effectiveness
at preventing memory errors.

The file "disaster.cpp" contains lots of memory errors that cause it
to crash (Linux) or produce unwanted results (Windows). DieHard avoids
all of these.

The file "crash-mozilla.htm" does just what you think it might -- it
crashes Mozilla (versions 1.0.2 and 1.7.3), usually
immediately. DieHard generally prevents these crashes (one is an
overflow, which DieHard avoids probabilistically).

Similarly, the file "crash-firefox-1.0.4.html" does just what it says
-- except when DieHard is running.
